## Usage Examples

### Patient Registration and Medical Record Creation
```solidity
// 1. Register patient
patientRecord.registerPatient(encryptedPersonalInfo, emergencyContact);

// 2. Grant access to doctor
patientRecord.grantAccess(doctorAddress, "doctor");

// 3. Doctor creates medical record
patientRecord.createMedicalRecord(patientAddress, encryptedData, "diagnosis", attachments);
```

### Insurance Claim Processing
```solidity
// 1. Create insurance policy
insuranceClaims.createInsurancePolicy(policyNumber, patientAddress, coverageAmount, deductible, expiryDate, conditions);

// 2. Provider submits claim
insuranceClaims.submitClaim(policyNumber, claimedAmount, diagnosis, treatmentCode, documents, false, recordId);

// 3. Automatic payment processing (if auto-approved)
paymentSystem.executeClaimPayout(claimId, providerAddress, amount, insurerAddress);
```

### Clinic Appointment Booking and Consultation
```solidity
// 1. Register clinic
clinicAppointments.registerClinic("City Health Clinic", "Downtown", services, contactInfo, "08:00-17:00", operatingDays, consultationFee, true);

// 2. Register doctor to clinic
clinicAppointments.registerDoctor(doctorAddress, clinicId, "Dr. Smith", "General Medicine", licenseNumber, fee, availableDays, timeSlots, 10, qualifications);

// 3. Create time slots
string[] memory times = ["09:00", "10:00", "11:00"];
clinicAppointments.createTimeSlots(doctorAddress, "2025-10-15", times, 30, consultationFee);

// 4. Book appointment
clinicAppointments.bookAppointment(doctorAddress, timeSlotId, ConsultationType.GeneralConsultation, symptoms, patientNotes, attachments, false);

// 5. Complete consultation
clinicAppointments.completeConsultation(consultationId, diagnosis, prescription, tests, nextAppointment, consultationNotes, followUpInstructions);
```
