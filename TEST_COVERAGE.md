# Test Coverage Report

This document provides an overview of the comprehensive test suite for the ChainCare smart contract ecosystem.

## Test Structure

Our test suite is organized to verify both individual contract functionality and integrated workflows:

### 1. Individual Contract Tests

## Test Coverage Metrics

Target coverage for production deployment:
- **Statement Coverage**: ≥95%
- **Branch Coverage**: ≥90%
- **Function Coverage**: ≥95%
- **Line Coverage**: ≥95%

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines with:
- Automated test execution on pull requests
- Gas usage reporting
- Coverage threshold enforcement
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Mock Contracts

The test suite includes mock contracts for external dependencies:
- **MockERC20**: Simulates stablecoin tokens (USDC, USDT, DAI)
- Test fixtures for consistent state setup
- Helper functions for common test patterns

## Performance Testing

Load testing scenarios include:
- High-volume patient registrations
- Concurrent appointment bookings
- Bulk insurance claim processing
- Supply chain batch operations

## Next Steps

1. Run the complete test suite: `npm test`
2. Generate coverage report: `npm run coverage`
3. Review gas optimization opportunities
4. Add additional edge case testing
5. Implement fuzzing tests for security validation
